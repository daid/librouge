# librouge
Traditional roguelike engine

Small C++ engine to quickly make a traditional Roguelike game.

It does:

* ascii/tile based rendering with pixel perfect scaling.
* Basic keyboard input handling.
* Handling of multiple modal states for easier menuing and stuff.
* Provides utilities for field of view and line of sight.
* Uses the excellent https://github.com/g-truc/glm library for 2d vector math.
* Add various useful utility classes, like a color class, 2d array and a rectangle class.

# It's spelled roguelike.
I know. The engine name is a joke towards the very common misspelling of Roguelike.

Shouldn't be taken to serious. Just like this engine. It's a toy, not something you would build a big game from.
